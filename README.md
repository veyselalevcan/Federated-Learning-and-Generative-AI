# üß† GAN-Based SCADA Attack Simulation & Anomaly Detection

This repository presents a research project focused on simulating **False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA)** on SCADA systems using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and detecting them with deep learning-based anomaly detection models.

## üìå Project Overview

- Simulate **multi-dimensional cyberattacks** using WGAN-GP on real SCADA sensor data (24 features).
- Inject synthetic attacks into normal SCADA data to generate realistic anomaly-rich datasets.
- Use anomaly detection models like **Autoencoders** and **LSTM-AE** to detect attacks in both centralized and federated setups.
- Visualize and analyze attack separation using feature distributions, t-SNE projections, and reconstruction error histograms.

**Figure Explanation:**

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Left: Feature Value Distribution** | Comparison of mean feature values per sample between Normal (blue) and GAN-generated attack (red) samples. Clear separation indicates statistical anomaly. |
| **Center: t-SNE Projection** | Dimensionality reduction highlights clear separation between Normal (blue circles) and Attack (red crosses) samples, suggesting effective attack simulation. |
| **Right: Reconstruction Error (MSE)** | Histogram of Autoencoder reconstruction errors. A threshold (e.g., 0.28) is used to classify potential anomalies. Most GAN attacks exceed this threshold. |

## üß¨ Methodology

1. **GAN-Based Simulation (WGAN-GP):**
   - Input: Normal samples from SWaT dataset.
   - Output: Synthetic attack samples that mimic FDIA behavior.

2. **Attack Injection:**
   - Generated attacks are injected into normal sequences to simulate contaminated sensor streams.

3. **Anomaly Detection Models:**
   - **Autoencoder (AE)**
   - **LSTM-AE**
   - **Transformer (optional extension)**

4. **Federated Learning Setup (optional):**
   - Clients receive partitioned datasets with local attacks.
   - Models are trained collaboratively without raw data sharing.

## üß† Model Evaluation

- **Reconstruction Loss (MSE):** Used to compute anomaly score per sample.
- **Detection Thresholding:** Empirically chosen from the validation set (e.g., 0.28).
- **Performance Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1, AUC.

## ‚ú® Future Work

- Integrate more attack types (DDoS, MITM).
- Extend to **cross-site federated learning** using additional ICS datasets (e.g., BATADAL).
- Use **VAE-GAN** or **Diffusion Models** for higher realism in attack simulation.
